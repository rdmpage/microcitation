N2  - A new species of the cumacean genus Eudrella (Leuconidae), is described from the central region of the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. Although female specimens of this species very closely resemble Eudrella truncatula (Bate, 1856) from the Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean Sea, male specimens are easily distinguished from E. truncatula in having only a single prominent tooth on the antero-lateral corner of the carapace, and a very long uropod endopod. In addition, the adult male antenna bears a short flagellum, which reaches to the anterior margin of the first or second abdominal segment and is a unique characteristic for the genus.

This genus is closely similar in general appearance to the genus Pella, but is clearly distinguished from it by having some plesiomorphic states in the labium, i.e., ligula with four setae, 1st segment of palpus much longer and wider than 2nd, and apodome with a medial projection. The systematic position remains uncertain.

It was collected on Nakanoshima Is., a part of the Tokara Archipelago (Tokara Retto), Kagoshima Prefecture, and is the first species of the Scydmaenidae known to occur on this island. The new species is externally similar to small Japanese Stenichnus bellulus Jaloszynski and S. minipollens Jaloszynski; its rather small body, dark pigmentation, relatively dense punctation on the elytra and unique aedeagus are unambiguous identification characters. Following recent taxonomic changes in Stenichnus, S. totoro Jaloszynski, S. bellulus Jaloszynski, and S. minipollens Jaloszynski, previously treated as incertae sedis, are placed in the subgenus Stenichnus.

This is the fourth member of the genus known from Vietnam (the third of the nominotypical subgenus), and its type material was collected in the Hoa Binh Province. The new species resembles S. difficilis Jaloszynski, S. thailandensis Jaloszynski, S. sake-tianus Jaloszynski, S. lamdongianus Jaloszynski and other similarly slender representatives of the genus. It can be identified on the basis of unique structures of the endophallus, which has very short proximal projection and the central complex is only slightly broader than the distal vesicle. Photos of habitus and illustrations of the aedeagus are given.

A species of the genus Tenagomysis is described as new to science. The occurrence of Australomysis acuta is the second record since Tattersall established this species in 1927. Notomysis australiensis is first recorded from Western Australia. An unnamed species belonging probably to the Leptomysini seems to be new, but the decision of the correct taxonomic position is reserved because the male is unknown. Paramesopodopsis rufa is first recorded from the other locality than the type locality, Tasmania. Idiomysis sp. is remained unnamed because of the damaged condition.

N2  - Host plants and position of the eggs and larval leaf-rolls are recorded for three Pamphilius species feeding on Alnus in Nagano Prefecture, central Honshu, based on rearing experiments made in 2004 to 2005. Host records are Alnus hirsuta Turcz. for Pamphilius nakagawai Takeuchi, 1930, P. archiducalis Konow, 1897, and P. flavipectus Shinohara, 2005, and Alnus matsumurae Call, for P. nakagawai and P. flavipectus. Alnus matsumurae is the first host record for P. flavipectus. Oviposition and leaf-rolls of P. nakagawai and P. archiducalis are usually on the under surface of the leaf, whereas those of P. flavipectus are on the upper surface of the leaf. The position of the eggs and leaf-rolls are newly recorded for P. flavipectus. The adults of P. flavipectus emerged one to three weeks later than those of P. nakagawai.

N2  - A new shrimp-associated goby, Myersina adonis, is described based on seven specimens (21.7-31.3mm in standard length) collected from shallow seagrass beds on the Andaman coast of Thailand. Myersina adonis is distinguished from the congeners in having: VI-I, 10 dorsal-fin rays; I, 9 anal-fin rays; 53-61 longitudinal scales; 4-5+14-17=18-21 gill rakers; united gill membranes with a distinct free rear margin across the isthmus at least in males (but not pronounced in most females); five transverse rows of sensory papillae on cheek; dorsal half of the body mottled with charcoal gray, without distinct longitudinal stripes; three faint, dusky vertical bars on side of belly; and a wedge-shaped black spot on pectoral-fin base. When alive or fresh, there are minute bright blue spots scattered on the head and body; minute reddish spots on the jaws; three or four irregular rows of red spots on the second dorsal fin; and a series of alternating red and yellow spots on membrane between first and second spines of the first dorsal fin in males.

N2  - Fresh- and brackish-water fishes caught in Lake Ogawara at Kamikita, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, were examined for helminth parasites in September 1997. Digeneans of seven species found are reported in this paper. Phyllodistomum biringo sp. nov. (Gorgoderidae) is described from adults found in the urinary bladder of Gymnogobius breunigii (Steindachner) (Gobiidae). Exorchis oviformis Kobayashi, 1915 (Cryptogonimidae) is redescribed from adults found in the intestine of Silurus asotus Linnaeus (Siluridae). The generic diagnosis of Exorchis Kobayashi, 1915 is amended in part.

N2  - A whale louse species referable to Cyamus (Apocyamus) scammoni Dall, 1872, a crustacean ectoparasite of the gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus (Lilljeborg), was found in great numbers on the body surface of a young individual that strayed into Tokyo Bay in mid-April, 2005, and was found dead in a fixed net on 11 May, 2005. In the northwestern Pacific populations of E. ro-bustus, the whale louse has been known only from Korean and southern Kamtchakan waters, and therefore the present record is the first from Japanese waters. The known species of the whale lice from Japanese waters are listed, with the host whale species.

N2  - Japanese species of the Elachista micromoths belonging to the E. cingillella-complex are revised. Seven species are recognized: E. nigriciliae sp. nov.; E. nozawana sp. nov.; E. para-gangabella sp. nov.; E. adscitella Stainton, 1851; E. cingillella (Herrich-Schaffer, 1855); E. fasciola Parenti, 1983; E. subalbidella Schlager, 1847. These species are rather uniform in coloration: the dark-colored forewing has a whitish transverse fascia around the middle, which may be strongly reduced or broadened. Elachista adscitella, E. cingillella and E. subalbidella are for the first time recorded from Japan. Specimens of E. fasciola from the easternmost part of Hokkaido have a strikingly broad fascia of the forewing in comparison with conspecific specimens from other localities. Information of the immature biology is given for E. nigriciliae, E. nozawana, E. adscitella and E. cingillella. Keys to the species are given, using the genital characters. Because of a strong resemblance in appearance to the E. cingillella-complex, Perittia unifasciella Sinev, 1992 is illustrated and included in the key.

N2  - Allantus nigripectus Matsumura, 1912 is synonymized with Allantus flavipectus Matsumura, 1912, because the color characters used to separate them have been found variable and the two taxa are not separable. Tenthredo nigripleuris (Enslin, 1910) is newly recorded from Japan based on the specimens previously identified with "T. devius". There is no evidence for the occurrence of Tenthredo devia (Konow, 1900) in Japan. Japanese populations of Tenthredo colon Klug, 1817 have been called "T. colon nigriventris Enslin, 1912" in Japanese literature but this usage of the subspecific name is erroneous. It is proposed not to recognize a subspecific taxon for Japanese populations until more is known about the geographic variations of this widely distributed Holarctic species. Tenthredo babai Takeuchi, 1936, previously known only from Honshu and Sado Island, is newly recorded from Kyushu.

N2  - Three shrimp-associated gobies, Cryptocentrus fasciatus, Flabelligobius russus and Flabelligobius smithi, were recently collected from Iriomote-jima Island, Yaeyama Islands of the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. Their occurrences represent the first record from Japanese waters and, also, the northernmost record for these species. Morphological features of the Japanese specimens of these species are described. F. russus has been frequently placed in Cryptocentrus in previous literature, but the species has a longitudinal pattern of sensory-papillae rows on the cheek (vs. distinct transverse pattern in Cryptocentrus), a uniserial transverse row of sensory papillae just behind the chin (vs. a pair of short longitudinal rows of sensory papillae), and the well-developed membrane between ventral arm of first gill arch and inner surface of buccal cavity (vs. not developed), characters which agree with the current diagnosis of Flabelligobius. The Japanese specimen of F. smithi has an intermediate condition between F. smithi (previously known only by three specimens from Taiwan) and its closest congener, F. fourmanoiri (known only by the holotype from Madagascar), in some proportional measurements and meristic counts. The Japanese specimen is, however, provisionally identified here as F. smithi, judging from other diagnostic characters listed in the original description (e.g., number of pectoral-fin rays and configuration of sensory-papillae rows on cheek) and by a new character: elongation of first dorsal-fin spines, viz., anterior two spines elongate and filiform in F.fourmanoiri vs. only a single (=first) spine elongate in F. smithi.

N2  - A new, deep-water species is assigned to the hermit crab genus Cestopagurus Bouvier, 1897, previously known from the eastern Atlantic and the western Indian Ocean, including the Red Sea. The assignment is made because of the similarities in the structure and number of the gills and in the sexual tube development in males. The new species, C. puniceus, substantially differs from the two congeneric species, C. timidus (Roux, 1830) and C. coutieri Bouvier, 1897, in the weak development of the rostrum, the markedly elongate antennular peduncles, the unarmed right chela, and the concave mesial face of the carpus of the right cheliped. The new species is the first representative of Cestopagurus from the Pacific Ocean.

Of them, Homolodromia kai Guinot, 1993 (Homolodromiidae), Latreillia metanesa Williams, 1982 (Latreillidae), and Cymonomus soela Ahyong et Brown 2003 (Cymonomidae) are newly recorded from Japanese waters. Psopheticus musicus Guinot, 1990 (Goneplacidae) is newly recorded in this report, but the previous records of occurrence of P. stridulans Wood-Mason in Japanese water is probably due to misidentification of this species. All the species are the typical deep-sea inhabitants.

N2  - Two new species of the gobiid fish genus Eviota, i.e., E. korechika and E. ocellifer, are described based on specimens from the West Pacific Ocean. E. korechika (19 type series and 9 non-type specimens, 12.3-24.4 mm SL, Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan, and Sulawesi, Indonesia) belongs to the subgroup bearing complete cephalic sensory-canal pore configuration for Eviota [i.e., pores B', C (unpaired), D (unpaired), E, F, H', N' and O']; it differs from the other 18 described species of this subgroup in having the following combination of characters: usually 9 and 8 dorsal- and anal-fin segmented rays, respectively; well-developed membranes between pelvic-fin segmented rays; edge of scale pockets densely pigmented, forming dusky reticulations on body; a narrow arc-shaped, diagonal pale band (subtranslucent in preserved specimen) at middle of first dorsal fin; 5-7 diagonal bright-blue to pale-blue bars (translucent and sometimes quite indistinct in preserved specimens) on second dorsal and anal fins in each; two ovoid dusky spots on dorsal and ventral parts of pectoral-fin base; no enlarged, distinct subcutaneous dusky spot on mid-lateral caudal peduncle; caudal fin without any conspicuous dusky markings. E. ocellifer (7 specimens, 16.4-18.4mm SL, Iriomote-jima Island, Yaeyama Islands of Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan) is similar to E. lacrimae and E. sparsa in lacking preopercular canal and associated pores of cephalic sensory systems, but differs from the latter two in having moderately developed fifth pelvic-fin ray (10.5-18.1% of preceding ray in length) and a conspicuous semi-ocellated spot at anteroventral part of first dorsal fin.

N2  - Laboratory observations revealed that colonies of the athecate hydroid Cytaeis uchidae Rees, 1962 on a gastropod host, Niotha livescens (Philippi), possessed heteromorphic polyps, characterized by highly elastic tentacles that were absent in normal polyps. Such tentacles were armed with huge basitrichous isorhiza-type nematocysts that did not occur in normal filiform tentacles. The tips of the highly elastic tentacles, in which abundant basitrichous isorhizas were concentrated, had the swollen appearance of capitate tentacles, such being characteristic of the suborder Capitata. Furthermore, the heteromorphic polyps were most frequently present on the periphery of the colonies along the aperture of the gastropod host.

N2  - A new horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus chiewkweeae is described on the basis of specimens collected from the Malay Peninsula. The new species is classified in the R. pearsoni group composed of R. pearsoni and R. yunanensis. Rhinolophus chiewkweeae shows adequate coefficients of differences in external and osteological characters to be separated at species level from R. pearsoni and R. yunanensis. The dimensional characters of the new species except short ears and tail are intermediate between those of the two species. The new species also shows color differences from R. pearsoni and R. yunanensis: the dorsal fur of the new species is orange brown, instead of the dark brown of R. pearsoni and R. yunanensis. Rhinolophus chiewkweeae inhabits a dipterocarp forest of the Malayan division, Sundai subregion, of the Indo Malayan region.

N2  - A new species of the myrmecophilous hoverfly genus Microdon (Syrphidae, Microdontinae), M. katsurai, associated with Polyrhachis lamellidens, is described in Honshu, Japan. This species is similar to M. stilboides Walker in its general appearance, but is easily distinguished by the coloration of its body and hairs and the shape of the scutellum. The symbiotic host, P. lamellidens, has rapidly declined in population throughout Japan as a result of residential and industrial development in its habitats. Microdon katsurai is probably an extremely rare species and will become endangered in the near future.

The biogeographical distribution of M. maxima is extended northwards to the North Pacific. A new species named M. kyushupalauensis is described from the Kyushu-Palau submarine ridge, southwestern Japan, as a fourth species in the genus. It differs from the known species in the confluent first and second anterolateral teeth of the carapace and the first male pleopod weakly curving and tapering toward the small terminal orifice.

N2  - Zodariid spiders of the genera Asceua Thorell, 1887, Mallinella Strand, 1906, and Akyttara Jocque, 1987, obtained from Dambri in Lam Dong Province, southern Vietnam, are reported. Four new species are described under the names, Asceua piperata, Mallinella momoina, Mallinella dambrica and Akyttara odorocci. The holotype (female) of Asceua torquata (Simon, 1909) described from Hanoi, northern Vietnam, was re-examined and illustrated for a comparison with the new species. Both the Asceua species closely resemble each other in the shape of epigynum. Mallinella dambrica seems to be related to M. klossi (Hogg, 1922) known from Lang Biang, about 100km apart from Dambri in a northeastern direction, while M. momoina shows peculiar characters in the genus, especially those of the structure of female genitalia. The genus Akyttara was discovered in Asia for the first time.

They are: M. macrocerus sp. nov., M. kidai sp. nov., M. yokohamai sp. nov., M. murayamai sp. nov., Microdon bifasciatus Matsumura, 1916, and M. simplex Shiraki, 1930 (new to Hokkaido). Larva and puparium of M. kidai are described. The following symbiotic hosts are clarified: M. macrocerus-Camponotus (Camponotus) obscuripes; Microdon kidai and M. yokohamai-Formica japonica (fusca group); M. murayamai-F. lemani (fusca group). Microdon japonicus and M. auricomus are formerly recorded from Hokkaido, but as those records are as highly doubtful that the two species could be excluded from the fauna of Hokkaido. Key to the species of Microdon in Hokkaido, including M. japonicus and M. auricomus, is appended for accurate identification.

Phang Si Pang in Lai Chau Province, northern Vietnam are taxonomically studied. Three new species are described under the names Mallinella paradisea, M. flammea and M. septemmaculata. Mallinella paradisea and M. flammea seem to belong to a small group in the genus with M. vietnamensis Ono, 2003 (Vietnam), M. uncinata (Ono, 1983) (Nepal) and M. irrorata (Thorell, 1895) (Myanmar), having filiform embolus and simple median apophysis on tegulum of the male palp, while M. septemmaculata is regarded as a member of the major group with many species from Nepal, Myanmar, China, Japan, and Vietnam, especially close to Mallinella hoosi (Kishida, 1935) from Japan and M. suavis (Thorell, 1895) from Myanmar in the structure of female genitalia. Male palpal organ and female genitalia of these new species are observed into details and illustrated.

N2  - Three species of spiders of the families Leptonetidae and Cybaeidae from Kumamoto Prefecture, Kyushu, western Japan, are reported. A new species of the genus Leptoneta Simon, 1872 (Leptonetidae) is described from Dosako, Sagara-mura, Kuma-gun, Kumamoto Prefecture, under the name of Leptoneta higoensis sp. nov. The spider was also found in some caves in Kumagun and Yatsushiro-gun of the same area. This new species seems to be closely related to Leptoneta yamauchii Nishikawa, 1982, known from a limestone cave in Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, but can be distinguished from the latter mainly by the structure of male palpal organ. Cybaeus kuramotoi Yaginuma, 1963 and an unknown species of Cybaeus (Cybaeidae) are recorded based on specimens obtained from Aso-gun in northern part of Kumamoto Prefecture.

N2  - Two new species of the genus Heteromysis are described on specimens which occurred in exhibition tanks in the Aquarium of the Kushimoto Marine Park Center, Wakayama, Japan. A species, Heteromysis kushimotensis sp. nov., closely resembles H. meenakshiae Bamber, 2000, but is distinguished from this species by the size of the cornea, the armature on the carpopropodus of the third thoracopodal endopod, the shape of the second female pleopod, and the spine number of the lateral margin of the telson. The other species, H. nomurai sp. nov., is identical with the atypical form of H. japonica Murano and Hanamura, 2002. This species is distinctly different from H. japonica in the shape of the rostrum, the armature of the merus, ischium and carpopropodus of the third thoracopodal endopod, and the spination of the uropodal endopod and telson.

The larva has several advanced or reduced characters which suggest abbreviated or recithotrophic development. Morphological characters of first zoea of R. debilis are compared with those of the other Pisinae, and it is noted that they are quite different from those of R. carpenteri (Thomson) in the absence of lateral spine of carapace and the setation of each appendage, and similar to those of Goniopugettia sagamiensis (Gordon) in the presence of mandibular palp and the setation of maxillule and Scyra compressipes Stimpson in the setation of maxilla and first maxilliped.

N2  - Paeneutheia pallida gen. et sp. nov. from Kalimantan, Borneo is described. The diagnosis of the new genus is based on the following characters: enlarged, subtriangular maxillary palpomere III; very short and broad palpomere IV; eyes in lateral view with deeply emarginate posterior margin; procoxae and mesocoxae relatively narrowly separated by pro- and mesosternal process; pronotum with basal groove; each elytron with single basal fovea and truncate apex; aedeagus with elongate, bulbous median lobe, well separated, slender apical part and long parameres. Current taxonomical problems with the classification of the Eutheiini are reviewed; morphological details characteristic for Paeneutheia gen. nov., Eutheia Stephens, Veraphis Casey, Protoeuthia Franz, and Euthiconus Reitter are illustrated and discussed. Redefinition of some genera is postulated; new diagnostic characters are proposed for Veraphis (fovea or grooves on vertex; and elongate, nearly tubular aedeagus without delimited basal part) and Eutheia (vertex without foveae and grooves; aedeagus with well separated, bulbous basal capsule). The diagnosis of Protoeuthia is supplemented with a detailed design of the aedeagus, which possesses a pair of parameres, overlooked in the existing literature. The genus Euthiconus is recognized as heterogenous and in need of comprehensive study.

The new species is easily distinguishable from its Japanese congeners by having all antennomeres longer than wide, distinctively more slender body and the shape of the aedeagus. Members of the tribe Cephenniini are known to occur in the forest floor; the new species is unique in inhabiting the intertidal zone of the Pacific coast. The male habitus and the aedeagus are illustrated.

(Digenea, Allocreadiidae), are described on the basis of adults found in the intestine of a freshwater fish, Phoxinus lagowskii steindachneri Sauvage (Osteichthyes, Cyprinidae), caught in the Hiroi River at Kotobuki, liyama, Nagano Prefecture, central Japan. Allocreadium shinanoense is most closely similar to A. tosai Shimazu, 1988, but it is different from the latter in having a larger body, a longer eversible ejaculatory duct, a more anterior extent of the vitelline follicles, and a shorter excretory vesicle. Allocreadium aburahaya is closely similar to A. tribolodontis Shimazu & Hashimoto, 1999, but it is different from the latter in having a larger sucker width ratio, irregularly indented testes, an ovate cirrus pouch, and larger eggs.

N2  - Specimens of spiders of the genus Mallinella Strand, 1906 (Zodariidae), obtained from Tam Dao National Park in Vinh Phu Province, northern Vietnam and from Bach Ma National Park in Thua Thien Hue Province, central Vietnam are taxonomically studied. Up to the present, only one Vietnamese species of this genus, Mallinella klossi (Hogg, 1922), was known from Mt. Langbian in Lam Dong Province of the southern part of this country. Four new species are recognized and described: Mallinella nomurai sp. nov. (male and female) and M. vietnamensis sp. nov. (male) from Tam Dao, M. karubei sp. nov. (male) and M. thinhi sp. nov. (female) from Bach Ma. Male palpal organ and female genitalia are observed into detailes and illustrated. Diagnosis for each species is given as summarized herewith: Mallinella nomurai seems to belong to a certain species group widely distributed in Asia and is regarded as a close relative of M. hoosi (Kishida, 1935) and M. fulvipes (Ono et Tanikawa, 1990) from southern Japan, M. martensi (Ono, 1983) from Mustang District, Central Nepal, and M. nigra (Bosnians et Hillyard, 1990) from Sulawesi, Indonesia, but is clearly distinguished from these species in details of male palpal organ, especially in the shape of median apophysis and embolus, and also in the structure of female genitalia. Mallinella vietnamensis resembles M. uncinata (Ono, 1983) described from Kaski District, Central Nepal and M. irrorata (Thorell, 1895) from Palon, Burma, but is easily distinguished from these by the filiform embolic division of male palp. Mallinella karubei is readily distinguished from all other congeners from Asia by the unique shape of median apophysis on tegulum of male palp and by having long and slender legs. Mallinella thinhi is closely allied to M. hingstoni (Brignoli, 1982) from Tibet, China and M. shimojanai (Ono et Tanikawa, 1990) from Iriomotejima Island, Japan in having globular spermathecae, but is distinguished from these species by the shape of epigynal plate much thinner than those of the other two species.

The new species is differentiated from A. gustavi Ng et Takeda and A. pluto Ng et Takeda which are two known representatives of the recently established genus, Atoportunus Ng et Takeda, 2003, most remarkably by having the narrower carapace and longer chelipeds. The chelae specially armed with long spines, small eyes, and elongated chelipeds and ambulatory legs are indicative of obligate cavernicolous habit in the dark.

N2  - Rhomphocallus gen. nov. (designated type species: Microglotta princeps Sharp, 1874) is described from the Palaearctic region and distinguished from similar oxypodine genera. The genus is characterized especially by dense and coarse puncturation of the forebody, slender antennae with sexual dimorphism, a distinctly transverse pronotum, very long tarsi, and above all a strongly developed beak-shaped ventral process of the adeagus. Three species are attributed to the genus: R. princeps (Sharp, 1874), comb, nov., R. maruyamai sp. nov., both from Japan, and R. bernhauen (Sainte Claire-Deville, 1907), comb, nov., from Europe; both R. princeps and R. bernhaueri are transferred from Haploglossa Kraatz, 1856. Distinguishing characters are illustrated. The following synonymy is proposed: Haploglossa gentilis (Markel, 1844)=Microglotta longicornis Thomson, 1868, syn. nov. A lectotype is designated for Microglotta princeps Sharp. Biogeographic evidence suggests that R. bernhaueri is of Eastern Palaearctic origin. The distributions are mapped.

N2  - A new species of the deep-water hyperbenthic calanoid genus Neoscolecithrix, N. japonica, is described, the first from Japan. This is the fifth member of the genus, and it can be readily distinguished from other congeners by relatively short antennules of both sexes, the segmentation and armature of male leg 5, no ornamentation of the female urosome, and the exopodal armature of female leg 5. The position of the genus within the group of five calanoid families with sensory setae on the mouthparts is discussed. Neoscolecithrix is here considered as a part of the family Scolecitrichidae complex and it may represent an early offshoot of the lineage leading to the crown group of the Scolecitrichidae.

N2  - Systematic study on the genus Anisomysis is dealt with on the basis of 21 species in our possession. A new subgenus and six new species are established. The new subgenus Pseudanisomysis is distinctly different from the other two subgenera, Paranisomysis and Anisomysis, in the eye cornea divided into two portions, the second antennular peduncle segment provided with a finger-like process, and the distal spines of the telson armed with a pair of small blunt processes at the base. Six new species are distinguished from allied species as follows: Anisomysis (Paranisomysis) omorii n. sp. by the telson with a U-shaped posterior cleft without spines in the anterior half, A. (Paranisomysis) parvisinuosa n. sp. by the telson having both a shallow lateral constriction and a shallow posterior sinus, A. (Paranisomysis) modestiangusta n. sp. by the rostrum with broadly rounded frontal margin and the telson armed with six pairs of spines on the posterior margin, A. (Anisomysis) rotunda n. sp. by the rostrum with broadly rounded frontal margin and the shape and armature of the telson, A. (Anisomysis) maldivensis n. sp. by the triangular rostrum and the exopod of the fourth pleopod of the male with the second segment less than half as long as the third segment, and A. (Anisomysis) parvispina n. sp. by the length ratio of three exopod segments of the fourth male pleopod and the minute marginal spines of the telson. Keys to the subgenus and to the species are given.

N2  - Two species of leaf-rolling sawfly, Pamphilius ignymontiensis Lacourt, 1973, and P. marginatus (Audinet-Serville, 1823), are newly recorded from Greece. Pamphilius ignymontiensis is known to occur in western and central Europe, and Croatia and Rumania are the southeasternmost localities so far recorded. Pamphilius marginatus is widely distributed in Europe, with southeastern records from Rumania, Macedonia, and Serbia. They are the second and third species of pamphiliid sawflies to be recorded from Greece. The record for P. ignymontiensis is based on a male specimen from Monodendri and that for P. marginatus is based on a female specimen from Vikos Gorge, both localities in the Ioannina province. The male Greek specimen of P. ignymontiensis differs from western European specimens in having more heavily punctured head and entirely black mesoscutellum and metascutellum. Another species, Pamphilius sylvaticus (Linnaeus, 1758), known to occur widely in Europe and Turkey, is newly recorded from Macedonia based on two male specimens from Mt. Galicica near Ohrid.

N2  - Horaeomorphus babai sp. nov. from Taiwan is described. Horaeomorphus taiwanensis Franz is transferred to Stenichnus Thomson (Stenichnus (Cyrtoscydmus) taiwanensis (Franz) comb. nov.). A redescription of Horaeomorphus chinensis Franz from the mainland China is given. Morphological differences between genera Euconnus, Stenichnus and Horaeomorphus are thoroughly discussed. The very high and narrow mesosternal carina is considered an unambiguous feature to separate Euconnus from the remaining discussed genera, which both possess mesosternal process only slightly expanded ventrally. The most useful characters to distinguish members of Horaeomorphus and Stenichnus were found to be: i) Horaeomorphus: subtriangular mandibles with subapical teeth; a pair of foveae on the vertex; raised supraantennal tubercles; elytra with two small basal pits covered by posterior margin of pronotum; modified hind trochanters in males of some species, ii) Stenichnus: slender, sickle-like mandibles without subapical teeth; the vertex without foveae; supraantennal tubercles slightly raised or not marked; elytra with basal pits not covered by base of pronotum; hind trochanters not modified in both sexes.

N2  - A new species of the genus Lathys Simon, 1884, is described from Iriomotejima Island, Ryukyu Islands, Southwest Japan under the name of Lathys insulana sp. nov. A list is presented for Japanese species of the genera Lathys, sensu lato (4 spp.) and Brommella Tullgren, 1948 (1 sp.), and their synonymy is explained. Lathys maculosa (Karsch, 1879) (originally Dictyna) and L. annulata Bosenberg et Strand, 1906, are revived respectively from junior synonyms of L. puta (O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1863) and L. humilis (Blackwall, 1855), both originally described under Ciniflo Blackwall, 1841. Lathys ocellata Bosenberg et Strand, 1906 and L. orientalis Bosenberg et Strand, 1906, are newly synonymized with L. maculosa, and L. novembris Donitz et Strand, 1906, is suggested to be synonymous with L. annulata. Transfer of Lathys puctosparsa Oi, 1957, to Brommella is supported.

Although we could not determine their certain species name, they were most probably identical with G. surugaensis, based on geographic distribution and osteological characters. The characters useful for identification of the juveniles of Grammatonotus are discussed with other Grammatonotus juvenile specimens from other areas.

N2  - Three species of Munida Leach, 1820 are reported from the shallow-water of the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands, southern Japan. The present record of Munida leptosyne Macpherson, 1994 greatly extends its geographical distribution northwards into the northern hemisphere, and the fresh color pattern of the species is described for the first time. Intraspecific morphological variations of Munida olivarae Macpherson, 1994, are discussed. The species usually inhabits in a small hole as probable empty tube of unidentified serpulid polychaete on the coral reef slopes. Munida kawamotoi sp. nov. is described on the basis of three specimens from Kume-jima Island of the central Ryukyus. This species appears closest to M. hyalina Macpherson, 1994, but is distinguished from the latter species primary by the structure of the seventh thoracic sternite, basal segment of the antennular peduncle, and fingers of the cheliped. The color photographs of three Munida species are also provided for their effective identification.

N2  - Ontogeny of the ophidiid fish, Brotulotaenia nielseni, is described based on seven specimens ranging from 10.0mm NL to 69.5mm SL, collected from tropical western Pacific. The so-called "rubaniform" is confirmed to represent larval stages of Brotulotaenia. Its selected features such as the slightly exterilium gut, enlarged first dorsal pteygiophore, unusually elongate ventral process of the coracoid, and peculiar structure of hypural plate are also observed and figured. Specialized larval morphs, i. e., rubaniform and exterilium (sensu Fraser and smith, 1974; currently ascribed to larval Lamprogrammus) are compared in detail and their close relationship is suggested. It is likely that the Brotulotaniinae is most close to some neobythitin genera including Lamprogrammus.

Of these species, P. macrophthalmus is restricted to freshwater basins, the remainder occurring in coastal and brackish waters. A diagnosis, synonymy, distribution, type material and references are given for each species, in addition to keys to the genera of Polynemidae and all Indo-Pacific Polydactylus species. All known available nominal species of Indo-Pacific Polydactylus are also listed.

N2  - The genus Pseudactea Serene, 1962 (Family Xanthidae) is systematically revised based on two known species, P. multicristata (Zehntner, 1894) and P. corallina (Alcock, 1898), and on a new species named P. multiareolata. Pseudactea multicristata is recorded for the first time from Japanese waters, extending its geographical range northward to central Japan from the known northernmost locality, Ilocos Sur, Luzon in the Philippines. The new species is apparently closer to P. multicristata than P. corallina in having the areolated dorsal surface of the carapace, but distinctly differs from it in having the more subdivided dorsal areolae and the regularly convex anterolateral margin, without angulated teeth.

The key to species of the genus is given and the geographical distributions of the five species are reported. Examinations of specimens of Oxynotus collected from the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean revealed that a problematic species O. shubnikovi Myagkov, 1986, is concluded to be a junior synonym of O. centrina (Linnaeus, 1758).

N2  - The life cycle of Metagonimus otsurui Saito & Shimizu, 1968 (Digenea, Heterophyidae) was studied in the Takami River at Kotsukawa, Higashiyoshino Village, Nara Prefecture, Japan. Metacercariae were found encysted in Rhinogobius flumineus (Mizuno) (Osteichthyes, Gobiidae). Adults were found in the small intestine of Chimarrogale himalayaica (Gray) (Mammalia, Insectivora, Soricidae). Metacercariae from naturally infected gobies were experimentally fed to golden hamsters, from the small intestine of which ovigerous adults were recovered 8 days after infection. Cercariae in daughter rediae were obtained from Semisulcospira libertina (Gould) and S. reiniana (Brot) (Gastropoda, Pleuroceridae). They were experimentally exposed to R. flumineus and fully formed metacercariae were recovered 24 and 38 days after infection. Although the prevalence and abundance of metacercariae were low in this experiment, it is considered that the cercaria is that of M. otsurui. The adults, metacercariae, daughter redia and cercaria are described. The life cycle of the species is briefly discussed.

N2  - A new gobioid genus, Terateleotris, is described for the sleeper species, previously known as Odontobutis aspro Kottelat, 1998,from the Xe Banghai basin. Laos. This is the third known gobioid genus bearing a lateral-line canal extending onto body, and the only genus with typical sleeper-like appearance within those three.T. aspro is redescribed, based on six newly obtained specimens, including soft anatomy and osteology. Terateleotris is clearly nested within the basal gobioid assemblage that includes the rhyacichthyids and odontbutids, owing to the lack of several modifications in scales, cephalic sensory canals, axial skeleton and shoulder girdle, all of which are found in the more specialized gobioids (e.g., Gobiidae). We, however, failed to adequately classify it into any known supra-generic taxon, because such taxa have vaguely defined limits, particularly the Odontobutidae.

N2  - Three hundred and eight species and 8 subspecies of fishes (310 species/subspecies), representing 160 genera in 70 families, were recorded from the rivers of the Ryukyu Archipelago. Most of these comprised indigenous fishes. although 18 species and 2 subspecies of introduced fishes were also recorded. Of the former, only 5 species were primary freshwater fishes, the others being diadromous. About 40 species/subspecies were collected primarily from freshwater. However, species' diversity was great in brackish water zone. The indigenous species/subspecies (except for 12 undescribed fishes, the distribution ranges of which remain undetermined) were classified into three zoogeographic categories : those from south of the Ryukyu Archipelago (southern species, 240 species/subspecies), those from the Ryukyu Archipelago to Japan proper (northern species, 29 species/subspecies) and those endemic to the Ryukyu Archipelago (11 species/subspecies). The number of species decreased gradually from the southern to northern islands.

Among 10 Ceratocephale species ever described world-wide the present species is closest to C. pacifica (Hartman, 1960) or C. pacifica (sensu Hutchings and Reid, 1990) in lacking mid-dorsal papillae in median body region and any falcigers and having double neuropodial cirri from setiger 1 and sesquigomph spinigers. But the present species differs from the latter two in having two pairs of distinct eyespots on the prostomium. While the present species is from the continental shelf area, the latter two are abyssal dwellers. This is the first record of this genus from Northwest Pacific region.

N2  - Thirteen species of digenean trematodes are recorded from halfbeaks and needlefishes of Japan and adjacent waters. One new genus and three new species are named : Hyporhamphitrema kamegaii gen. & sp. nov. from Hyporhamphus dussumieri of Japan, Bivesiculoides triangularis sp. nov. (Bivesiculidae) from Hyporhamphus quoyi of the Philippines and Brachyenteron japonicum sp. nov. (Zoogonidae) from Hemiramphus sajori of Japan. Hyporhamphitrema differs from the related waretrematids by having a simple type of hermaphroditic sac which includes a hermaphroditic duct and distal ends of male and female ducts. A new family Hyporhamphitrematidae is proposed for Hyporhamphitrema. The following taxonomic changes are proposed : Bucephalopsis southwelli Nagaty, 1937,B. lenti Nagaty, 1937,B. magnacetabulus Nagaty, 1937,B. tylosuris Ozaki & Ozaki, 1952,B. obpyriformis Gu & Shen, 1976,B. ablennus Gu & Shen, 1976 and B. bennetti (Hopkins & Sparks, 1958) of Gu & Shen, 1976,all from needlefishes, are synonymous with B. karvei Bhalerao, 1937.

N2  - The Vietnamese species of the trechine genus Agonotrechus are dealt with. Of the five species hitherto found, mostly on the Hoang Lien Son mountain range, only one large species, A. tonkinensis Jedlicka, was previously described. It is carefully redescribed, since its original description is not satisfactory and appeared in a paper rather difficult to obtain. The other four species are newly described in this paper under the names A. campanulatus, A. nomurai, A. amplicollis and A. vina. Their affinities are discussed and the mode of their occurrence is also recorded. A key is given to the Vietnamese species of Agonotrechus.

N2  - Nematode specimens taken from the stomach of Japanese cormorants (Phalacrocorax capillatus) collected on the coast of the Japan Sea in central Japan were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy and identified as Contracaecum himeu Yamaguti, 1941. Although the taxonomic validity of this nematode species remained uncertain, the present study shows that it is a valid species and definitely differentiated from a closely related species, C. rudolphii, specimens of which were also examined from Europe. Contracaecum himeu is redescribed, and the shape of the interlabium, i.e., its massive construction and a markedly rounded distal end, is important to differentiate the species from its congeners. The Japanese cormorant is a new host. The body length-weight relationship is also shown for both sexes of C. himeu.

N2  - Onuphid polychaetes belonging to the genus Onuphis collected from various areas around Japan and adjacent seas were examined. Sixteen species including 6 species new to science and 1 undetermined species are described. Zoogeographical consideration for the Onuphis species described above and 7 more species which were collected from various Japanese coasts and the adjacent seas and were reported by other authors elsewhere clearly shows that (1) each Onuphis species tends to occur in a somewhat limited area, (2) the faunal elements are highly segregated between the northeastern and the southwestern parts around Japan and (3) quite a few species occur in single restricted collecting sites.

N2  - A new species, Metagonimus hakubaensis sp. n. (Digenea, Heterophyidae), is described and illustrated on the basis of adults recovered from the small intestine of rats which were experimentally fed metacercariae found in ammocoetes of a lamprey, Lethenteron reissneri (Dybowski) (Agnatha, Petromyzontidae), collected in a stream in Hakuba Village, Nagano Prefecture, central Japan. This new species is closely similar to M. katsuradai Izumi, 1935 and M. otsurui Saito et Shimizu, 1968 in that the oral sucker is larger than the ventral; but it is different from them in that neither the caeca nor the vitelline follicles extend posteriorly beyond the posterior testis, and the uterus hardly enters the post-testicular region. Mother and daughter rediae and cercariae of the new species are described from a prosobranch snail, Semisulcospira dolorosa (Gould) (Gastropoda, Pleuroceridae), from the same stream.

N2  - Twenty-eight species of digeneans are recorded from tetraodontiform fishes of Japanese and adjacent waters. Five new species and two new genera are named : Sacculoacetabulum ohjibah gen. & sp. nov. (Zoogonidae), Deretrema (Spinoderetrema) triodontis sp. nov. (Zoogonidae) and Neomegacreadium okinawanum gen. & sp. nov. (Schistorchiidae) from Triodon macropterus; Lobatocreadium magnum sp. nov. (Lepocreadiidae) from Ostracion cubicus. Sacculoacetabulum is characterized by a balloon-shaped acetabulum, the orifice of which is narrow, located at the midanterior edge and surrounded by powerful muscular sphincter. Neomegacreadium is distinguished from the related Megacreadium by having a mouth enclosed by a broad muscular lobe anteriorly and muscular bundle lateroposteriorly, a uroproct, ten or occasionally 11 or 12 testes, vitellaria extending to the posterior level of the oral sucker. The following taxonomic changes are proposed : Maculifer chilomycteri Yamaguti, 1959 is synonymous with Heterolebes maculosus Ozaki, 1935; Aponurus vitellograndis Layman, 1930 and A. rhinoplagusiae Yamaguti, 1934 are synonymous with A. laguncula Looss, 1907.

N2  - Pamphilius albopictus subgroup of the P. vafer group is defined to include three Palearctic species, i.e., P. heecheonparki sp. nov. occurring in East Siberia to Korea, P. albopictus (Thomson, 1871), probably a thelytokous species distributed in Europe to Kamchatka and Korea, and P. kamikochensis Takeuchi, 1930,from Japan. Based on examination of the type material, P. albopictus and P. kamikochensis are redescribed, the synonymy of P. altaicus Gussakovskij, 1935,with P. albopictus is confirmed, and P. viridipes Achterberg & Aartsen, 1986,described from The Netherlands is newly synonymized with P. albopictus. Pamphilius albopictus is newly recorded from Switzerland, Ukraine and Korea.

N2  - A rare cirrhitid fish, Amblycirrhitus unimacula, was collected from Yonaguni-jima Island of Ryukyu Islands, Japan. It represents the third known specimen of the species. Our examination of the holotype reveals that the original description includes errors including the standard length. Intraspecific variations were revealed by careful comparison of our specimen with the holotype. Collection data for our specimen in conjunction with literature records suggests that this species inhabits cryptic areas within rocky reefs.

N2  - We examined 119 melon-headed whales, Peponocephala electra, which stranded on a stretch of about 1.6km of coast at Aoshima (31°47′N, 131°29′E), Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, in the early morning of 6 January 1982. We confirmed the presence of 84 live animals (70.6% of the total animals examined) during our 4hour examination (10 : 00a.m.-14 : 00p.m.) on 7 January. Body length of 109 animals (68 males and 41 females) examined ranged from 211 to 264cm for males and from 209 to 256.5cm for females. The relationship between body weight (Y in kg) and body length (X in cm) is shown by the following equation : Y=0.0000192X^<2.91>. The sex ratio (female % of the total) of 119 animals was 39.5%. Of 39 females examined on reproductive condition, 34 (87.2% of the total number of females) were sexually mature, comprising 10 pregnant (29.4% of the sexual mature females), 13 lactating (38.2%) and 11 resting animals (32.4%). Sexually mature females ranged from 11.5 to 44.5 years of age and from 231 to 256.5cm in body length. The annual ovulation rate was estimated at 0.28. Possible sexually mature males having a testis weight of 200g or more ranged from 16.5 to 38.5 years of age and from 244 to 264cm in body length. The rate of sexual maturity of 36 males examined was estimated at 72.2%. Maximum testis weight was 1040g. Physically mature animals were found to be 13.5 years or older, and all 14 animals of over 17 years were physically mature. The vertebral formula was C7+T(13-16)+L(15-18)+Ca(39-45)=78-83. Nasitrema gondo was found in the tympanic cavity of all 20 animals dissected in the laboratory.

In its general morphology, the new species resembles members of the genus Viaderiana Ward, 1942,but lacks the stout and strongly recurved male first pleopod and armed ambulatory meri present in members of this genus.

N2  - Web-spinning sawflies known to feed on larch are reviewed and four Palearctic species, one of them polytypic, of two genera are recognized and keyed. They are Acantholyda nipponica Yano & Sato, 1928,from Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu), Acantholyda laricis (Giraud, 1861) from Europe, Siberia, China and Japan (Honshu), Cephalcia lariciphila lariciphila (Wachtl, 1898) from Europe, Siberia and China, Cephalcia lariciphila japonica subsp. nov. from Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu), and Cephalcia koebelei (Rohwer, 1910) from Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu) and eastern Siberia. Cephalcia baikalica Verzhutskij, 1973,is newly synonymized with C. koebelei. These four species are actual or potential pests of larch plantations. Previous records of outbreaks of these sawflies in Japan are summarized.

N2  - Two new species of the tribe Erythropini, Mysidacea, Gibberythrops longicauda and Nakazawaia secunda, are described from Japanese waters. G. longicauda is distinguished from the three known species of the genus by the pair of shorter spines on the apex of telson and the larger number of spines on the endopod of uropod. N. secunda is easily distinguished from the type species by the telson with spines not occupying the whole margin, and therefore the generic diagnosis of Nakazawaia is amended. A key for the identification of the species of Gibberythrops is also included.

N2  - Japanese salticid spiders of the genera Harmochirus, Bianor and Stertinius are enumerated. Chirothecia insulana Kishida, 1914,never recognized since its original description, is redescribed based on new materials and transferred to Harmochirus. This spider has long been misidentified with an Indonesian species, Harmochirus brachiatus (Thorell, 1877). Harmochirus nigriculus Logunov et Wesolowska, 1992,recently described from the Russian Far East, is newly recorded from Japan and redescribed on the basis of Japanese materials. Harmochirus niger Kishida, 1910,is regarded as a junior synonym of Harmochirus pullus (Bosenberg et Strand, 1906). Two new species are described from Japan under the names Bianor japonicus sp. nov. and Stertinius kumadai sp. nov. The genus Stertinius is new to the Japanese fauna. Diagnoses are given for the three genera.

N2  - Two sets of eggs and larvae of species of bathyal octopus are described from New Zealand. Both sets of eggs are deposited in clusters, each cluster comprising large egg capsules with short stalks individually cemented to the substratum. Egg capsules from both clusters are similarly teardrop-shaped and without apparent external sculpture, however, capsule and stalk lengths differ between the two, 24.0-26.2×1.5-3.0mm and 20.5-21.7mm×2.0-3.6,respectively. Larvae just hatching out the capsules from one set of eggs are attributed to the genus Graneledone, while the second set of eggs without larvae cannot presently be identified to the generic level. A comparison between larval, juvenile and adult stages of Thaumeledone and Graneledone species is made.

N2  - We examined osteometrically two mandibles of feral pig from Savai'i Island of Western Samoa. Sex and age were determined by observation of molars. These two male mandibles of similar age are obviously different in shape and proportion. It suggests that various breeds of domesticated pig have been introduced to Savai'i Island and established in the forest. The present data are useful to clarify the history of feral pig in the South Pacific region including Western Samoa.

B. gymnothoracis sp. nov. found in the intestine of Gymnothorax kidako (Muraenidae) from Japan is different from the most closely allied B. ostichthydis SHEN, 1982 in having a broader body and smaller eggs. B. obovata sp. nov. found in the pyloric ceca of Sargocentron rubrum (Holocentridae) from Japan is different from the most closely allied B. hepsetiae MANTER, 1947 in having a larger and broader body and more anteriorly distributed vitellaria. B. palauensis sp. nov. found in the intestine of Variola louti (type host) and Epinephelus microdon (both Serranidae) from the Palau Islands is different from the most closely allied B. tarponis SOGANDARES-BERNAL et HUTTON, 1959 in having a larger pharynx, a shorter esophagus, a smaller testis, a much more spacious pars prostatica, a very short ejaculatory duct and larger eggs. Specimens found in the intestine of Brotula multibarbata (Ophidiidae) from Japan are provisionally assigned to B. ostichthydis. Specimens (Bivesicula spp. 1 and 2) found in the intestine of G. kidako and the pyloric ceca of E. fasciatus, respectively, both from Japan remain unidentified.

N2  - Four species of the spiders of the families Eresidae, Araneidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae from eastern Asia are reported. Stegodyphus tibialis (O. PICKARD-CAMBRIDGE, 1869) (Eresidae) is newly recorded from northwestern Thailand. This record indicates the easternmost locality in the spiders of the genus Stegodyphus known at present. Three new species are described, that is, Cyrtarachne melanoleuca sp. nov. (Araneidae; from eastern Thailand), Sanmenia kohi sp. nov. (Thomisidae; from Singapore) and Onomustus kanoi sp. nov. (Salticidae; from the Ryukyu Islands, southern Japan). Sanmenia kohi sp. nov. is the second species of the genus hitherto known only from Japan and China. The peculiar jumping spider genus, Onomustus, is recorded as new to the Japanese fauna.

N2  - Two trechine genera so far known only from tropical areas of northern Vietnam are dealt with. One of them is Trechiotes JEANNEL with two known species, T. perroti (JEANNEL) and T. luticola sp. nov., both fully winged; the other is a new genus, Paratrechiotes, with one apterous species, P. ocydromoides sp. nov. All the taxa are either described or redescribed, their affinities are discussed, and condition of their existence is explained.

N2  - The flexor digitorum superficialis of Slow Loris (Nycticebus coucang and N. pygmaeus) was examined. Close observations both on the muscular composition and on the innervation under dissecting microscope revealed that this muscle is consisted of two distinct portions, the proximal and the distal. The proximal portion receives two nerve branches at the cubital fossa, one from the median nerve and the other from the ulnar, and the distal belly is innervated by a small twig of the median nerve, which bifurcates far distal from the aforementioned branch. This last branch, with which the exact identification of the muscle is achieved, has not been described in Prosimii by any preceding authors. Findings on the innervation imply that the proximal portion has intimate relation with the deep flexors of the forearm, whereas the distal portion is derived from the intrinsic flexors of the hand. Consequently, the forearm flexors of the Slow Loris are classified into three groups : 1) Elbow matrix, 2) Forearm matrix, and 3) Intrinsic hand matrix.

N2  - A pair of ovaries of a Stejneger's beaked whale, Mesoplodon stejnegeri, were studied histologically. The animal was 4.8m in total length, stranded on the coast of Noh Town, Niigata Prefecture, facing the Sea of Japan, in late February 1993. The ovaries were 42 and 37mm in length and 6.7 and 3.3g in weight, respectively. After removal from the decomposing body, the ovaries were initially preserved in 10% formalin solution. Subsequently, after 15 months, they were postfixed in Bouin's solution. Light microscopy revealed several tens of primary follicles in the connective tissue stroma of the cortical region, in contrast to the conditions in previously described specimens. Well-developed corpora albicantia were present throughout, whereas neither a well-defined corpus luteum nor characteristically coiled and thick-walled arteries were detected in any of the blocks examined.

One of them, named Trechus vietnamicus, resembles T. bakeri JEANNEL from the Island of Luzon in the Philippines, but appears to belong to a different species-group. The other also belongs to the Trechus complex but forms a new genus of its own mainly because of the peculiarities of the protarsi and genitalia in the male. It is an unusually small species, and is named Vietotrechus minutissimus.

N2  - Systematic status of two Trechus species previously considered to belong to T. (s. str.) nakaguroi is scrutinized mainly on the basis of a comparative study of their male genitalia. One of them is described as a distinctive new species, T. sikhotealinus. The other is considered to be a full species, T. sachalinensis, though differentiation between this and T. nakaguroi is at a sibling stage. Brief notes are also given on the other species of the subgenus Trechus (s. str.) from Northeast Asia.

Adult morphology and ecology of a new species, Polydora vulcanica, are described. The species inhabits mud tubes in the intertidal and subtidal zones. Large settlements of P. vulcanica (with density of up to 100,000 individuals per 1 square metre) were recorded in the craters of two volcanoes on the Middle Kurile Islands. It occurs also near southeastern Kamchatka and off the Shumagin Islands, the Aleutian Islands.

The type species of the genus is M. palustris, which is a different bird from M. pryeri in many respects. We suggest that pryeri be placed in the genus Locustella until its relationships with other sylviine species are better known.

The living period was 2,407 days, which is the longest record among hybrids ever recorded in the world. The specimen was a female of 277cm in body length and was sexually immature. The present hybrid specimen showed intermediate values in cranial characters between T. truncatus and G. griseus. Relationship of the hybrid specimen to Fraser's three anomalous specimens, T. truncatus and G. griseus was discussed using the principal component analysis of 16 cranial characters.

Exacanthomysis japonica is distinguishable from three known species of the genus by the different number of the carpo-propodus subsegments of third to eighth thoracic endopods, and the shape and armature of the distal part of telson. Acanthomysis longicauda is different from five allied species, in which a transverse spine row is present on the sixth abdominal somite, in the sizes of eye and distal spines of telson. Acanthomysis quadrispinosa has been known from Madagascar and the northern South China Sea up to date. The present occurrence in Japan far extends easterly and notherly the geographic distribution of the species.

Liphistius ornatus sp. nov. and L. owadai sp. nov. are closely related not only to each other but also to L. desultor SCHIODTE, 1849,from northern Malaysia and L. bicoloripes ONO, 1988,from southern Thailand. These four species were found at lower altitudes and their females have orange-coloured femora and carapace. Liphistius ochraceus sp. nov. resembles the dull-coloured species from the mountainous areas of northwestern Thailand and eastern Burma and appears closest to L. yamasakii ONO, 1988. Biological information about L. ornatus sp. nov. is given.

The female is described here for the first time; 2) S. yamagutii sp. n. is characteristic in having bifurcated ventral ray, no inner projection on the lateral ray, and two large bosses just before and behind the vulva; and 3) The original description of the female of Pharurus dalli erroneously included a different species, S. yamagutii. The amended description and the taxonomic comment are given.

N2  - Five species of hemiurid trematodes from tropical marine fishes of southern Japan are described, that is, Genolinea kyphosi, G. chilostoma, Neotheletrum akeh n. sp., Gonocercella trachinoti and Aponurus laguncula. Neotheletrum akeh n. sp. from Siganus virgatus differs from N. frontilatum (MANTER, 1969) in that the testes lie away from the acetabulum, the uterus does not extend near the posterior extremity, the pars prostatica is oval, and there is a uterine vesicle. It is made clear that YAMAGUTI (1970) described Genolinea kyphosi without knowing the presence in it of two different species. Namely, the holotype and paratypes of G. kyphosi correspond to G. isuzumi MACHIDA, 1980 and G. chilostoma MACHIDA, 1980,respectively. Accordingly, G. isuzumi becomes a synonym of G. kyphosi.

N2  - The following five species of bivalves were recorded from the intertidal sandy beach of Pari Island, northwestern Java, Indonesia : Atactodea striata, Davila plana, Latona faba, Asaphis violascens and Gafrarium tumidum. The first two species were relatively common, and they were found living in the intertidal zone where the substrate was made up of loose sand grains. They were not found subtidally. The other three species were substantially less frequent or even rare, but they may be found subtidally as well. On the basis of population density and the frequency of occurrence, Atactodea striata was the dominant species. It was found in all transects that were made and one transect even showed a pure population of this species. Davila plana was second in abundance. The lateral distribution of A. striata displayed a more extended distribution than D. plana which showed the tendency of occupying the lower tidal level. As regard the vertical distribution within the substrate, A. striata occupied the surface layer, D. plana the upper mid-layer and Asaphis violascens the bottom layer. The length frequency distribution of A. striata took the form of normal, unimodal curve, suggesting that there was no definite spawning seasonality in this species.

Of these, six are new to science and are described under the names, C. ultramarina, C. cirrosa, C. ryukyuensis, C. viridula, C. insulana and C. tanikawai; the remaining one is identified with C. jucunda (KARSCH, 1879), the only species previously recorded from this island. Judging from their morphological characteristics, especially the male and female genital organs, these species are not closely related to one another, but are derived from different origins, respectively.

N2  - The Taiwanese species of the trechine genus Epaphiopsis are dealt with. They are classified into ten species of two different lineages. The multipunctata group is more archaic and more intensively differentiated than the formosana group, and is considered older than the latter, which is at the sibling level of speciation. The former contains five species, named E. multipunctata, E. kasaharai, E. elegans, E. divarboris and E. yushana spp. nov.; the latter also contains five species, E. formosana (JEDLICKA), E. apiceplana, E. shibatai, E. alticola and E. hsuehshana spp. nov. A new endemic subgenus, Formosiellus, is erected for receiving these species, all of which are wingless and restricted to the subalpine and/or alpine zones of central mountains on the island.

N2  - To improve knowledge of school structure of killer whale, Orcinus orca (LINNAEUS, 1758), the composition of 18 schools (705 individuals in total) were analyzed from the sighting information obtained through a 57-day sighting survey in the Southern Ocean between 115°E and 160°W. The fundamental units of the school of killer whales are considered to be the single adult male, the adult female with calf, and other whales including the juvenile whale and/or the adult female without calf. An aggregation of schools seems to be formed by combination of several large schools, each of which has some unit schools.

N2  - This paper deals with the following species of the trematode genus Allocreadium LOOSS, 1900 (Allocreadiidae), found in freshwater fishes of Japan : A. gotoi (HASEGAWA et OZAKI, 1926), comb.n. (syn. Macrolecithus gotoi HASEGAWA et OZAKI, 1926); A. hasu OZAKI, 1926; A. isoporum (LOOSS, 1894) LOOSS, 1900; A. japonicum OZAKI, 1926; A. tosai sp. n.; and Allocreadium sp. of KATAOKA and MOMMA (1934). The morphology of each species is described and illustrated, and its systematic position is discussed. Allocreadium tosai from Tribolodon hakonensis, T. ezoe and Moroco percnurus sachalinensis of Hokkaido differs from the most closely allied species, A. baueri SPASSKII et ROITMAN, 1960,in a larger body, a smaller sucker width ratio and larger eggs. Macrolecithus HASEGAWA et OZAKI, 1926,is regarded as a synonym of Allocreadium, and four species (including the type species) previously placed in Macrolecithus are transferred to Allocreadium as a new combination. In addition, some unidentified related trematodes are recorded.

N2  - Eight species of Delphinidae (Orcinus orca, Lagenorhynchus cruciger, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, Globicephala melaena, Delphinus delphis, Stenella coeruleoalba, Lissodelphis peronii, and Grampus griseus) and two species of Ziphiidae (Berardius arnuxii and Hyperoodon planifrons) were sighted during the minke whale assessment cruises in the Southern Hemisphere for three seasons, 1978/79,1979/80 and 1980/81. Geographical distribution, relative density, school size, surface water temperature at sightings and characteristic behavior of the above ten species were examined in the present study. Killer whales and beaked whales were concentratedly sighted along the ice edge of 60-70°S and in the Ross Sea. Apparent segregation between killer whales and beaked whales were observed in their overlapped areas, and the former whales showed higher density in the Ross Sea than the latter. Both long-finned pilot whales and hourglass dolphins were sighted in the north and south of the Antarctic Convergence like killer whales and beaked whales. On the other hand, other five delphinid species were found only in the north of the Antarctic Convergence. Most of beaked whales (71.5%) were sighted in solitary or pair, although delphinid species were composed of relatively larger school of several animals to about one thousand animals. Seven types of multi-species combination were observed as follows : 1) killer whales and minke whales, 2) long-finned pilot whales and minke whales, 3) long-finned pilot whales and southern right whale dolphins, 4) beaked whales and minke whales, 5) hourglass dolphins and fin whales, 6) killer whales and humpback whales, 7) longfinned pilot whales, southern right whale dolphins and hourglass dolphins.

N2  - Two new species of the genus Cossura from western Japan are described under the names of C. lepida and C. duplex. C. lepida closely resembles C. pygodactilata JONES, 1956 in the form of the pygidium; however, C. lepida differs from the latter in the number of peristomial segments and uniramous segments. C. duplex is unique in having biannulated anterior segments, three short anal cirri and flattened neurosetae with abrupt tapered tips.

Examination of the type material of Acanthobothrium triacis YAMAGUTI, 1952 led to an emendation of the original description and transfer of this species to genus Onchobothrium resulting in the new combination Onchobothrium triacis. The hooks of O. convolutum and O. triacis were found to be very similar. In both species the lateral hook is composed of a hollow axial prong, a talon, and a hollow abaxial process that appears to be homologous to the full abaxial prong seen in several other onchobothriid genera.

N2  - A small collection of crabs of the genus Quadrella (Trapeziidae) was examined. This study revealed that, of three species previously recorded from Japanese waters, Q. boopsis ALCOCK, Q. granulosa BORRADAILE and Q. maculosa ALCOCK, the first two species should be corrected to Q. bispinosa BORRADAILE and Q. coronata DANA, respectively, and that Q. reticulata ALCOCK is newly added to the Japanese carcinological fauna. Descriptive and distributional information is given for the four Japanese species.

N2  - An elongated thomisid spider newly collected in the Japanese subtropics is identified with Mecostrabus aciculus SIMON, 1903,based on the comparison with its type specimens. The species was known only from Vietnam. After a careful examination, it is regarded as a member of the genus Monaeses THORELL, 1869,and a new combination Monaeses aciculus (SIMON, 1903) is proposed. As it was designated as the type species of Mecostrabus SIMON, 1903,the latter falls into a junior synonym of Monaeses. The spider is redescribed with the new material from Japan, Taiwan and Nepal, and its male is first made known to science.

N2  - The beetles of the family Lymexylonidae occurring in eastern and southeastern Asia are discussed. The genus Atractocerus PALISOT DE BEAUVOIS, 1801,is split into five genera, Atractocerus s. str., Raractocetus nov., Fusicornis PHILIPPI, 1866,Hymaloxylon nov. and Arractocetus nov., chiefly by the cephalic structure. Atractocerus mirabilis MIWA, 1935,and Hylecoetus formosanus MIWA, 1935,both described from Formosa, are synonymized with Raractocetus emarginatus (CASTELNAU, 1836) from tropical Asia and H. flavellicornis (SCHNEIDER, 1791), from the Palearctic Region respectively. Lymexylon oculare NAKANE, 1963,from Japan is transferred to the genus Melittomma MURRAY, 1867. Neohylecoetus Y. KUROSAWA, 1956. is regarded as a synonym of Melittomma; N. javanicus Y. KUROSAWA, 1956,from Java and N. philippensis Y. KUROSAWA, 1956,from the Philippines are both synonymous with M. javanicum (CHEVROLAT, 1829). Lymexylon amamianum sp. nov. from the Ryukyu Archipelago and Formosa and Arractocetus monticola sp. nov. from Formosa are described. The beetle recorded under the name of Atractocerus niger STROHMEYER, 1910,from Formosa is divided into two species, and together with true niger STROHMEYER and morio PASCOE, the four allied species are shown in a key. Problems on the behaviour of some species concerning with the size of the eyes and on the mimicry are discussed.

N2  - Two new and two known opecoelid trematodes are described from goatfishes (Mullidae) in Japan. Dactylostomum tanegashimense sp. n., found in the pyloric caeca and intestine of Upeneus bensasi (?) at Tanega-shima, is characterized by the acetabulum with two pairs of apertural and four pairs of peripheral papillae, and the anterior extent of vitellaria lying near the posterior border of acetabulum. D. longivesiculum sp. n., obtained from the pyloric caeca and intestine of Parupeneus indicus at Ishigaki-jima, is characterized by having the seminal vesicle longer and more winding, the acetabulum with two pairs of apertural and four pairs of peripheral papillae, and the vitellaria the anterior extremity of which reaches halfway between the ovary and the acetabulum. In addition to the above, some morphological and taxonomic notes are given on Paropecoelus elongatus (OZAKI, 1928) (syn. P. adelongatus (NAGATY, 1954)) and P. quadratus (OZAKI, 1928)comb. n.

N2  - Several Japanese species of crab spiders are revised from various points of view. Three misidentified species are named correctly; Pistius undulatus KARSCH, 1879 (nec P. truncatus : BOSENBERG & STRAND (1906), etc.), Xysticus bifidus PAIK, 1973 (nec X. lateralis atrimaculatus : YAGINUMA (1960), etc.), and Diaea gyoja sp. nov. (nec D. dorsata : CHIKUNI (1955), etc.). The holotype of Thomisus coronatus GRUBE, 1861,from Siberia is redescribed. This species is transferred to the genus Lysiteles SIMON, 1895,and is considered to be a senior synonym of the Japanese species, Oxyptila takashimai UYEMURA, 1937. Oxyptila decorata KARSCH, 1879,is transferred to the genus Bassaniana STRAND, 1928,hitherto synonymized with Coriarachne THORELL, 1870,and is regarded as a senior synonym of Coriarachne japonica SIMON, 1886,and Eremita typica KISHIDA, 1914 (nom. nud.), both recorded from Japan. A new genus, Takachihoa, related to Synaema SIMON, 1864,is established with the type species Oxyptila truciformis BOSENBERG et STRAND, 1906. The only known Japanese species of the genus, Oxyptila nipponica sp. nov., is described.

N2  - Cephalopods collected with micronekton nets in the Subarctic North Pacific are shown to be primarily young stages of the family Gonatidae. Regional and seasonal changes of abundance of cephalopods in the northern North Pacific are discussed. A pattern of low winter abundance with a rapid early summer increase and gradual autumn decrease is evident. Distribution patterns of species in the family Gonatidae show good correlation with large scale oceanographic features. The distribution types include pan-Subarctic forms of two kinds, including and excluding the Sea of Okhotsk; northeastern Pacific endemics; California Current endemics; western Subarctic endemics; and species localized within the Sea of Okhotsk. The Sea of Okhotsk and California Current showed distinctive faunal and gonatid species composition. Species of the family Gonatidae are classified into four groups according to the geographical pattern of relative abundance of the early life stages. One group shows high abundance in neritic waters, another in offshore waters, a third is intermediate, and larvae of the fourth group were rarely or never caught. The geographical area and timing of spawning or hatching are estimated for most gonatid species. A growth curve is derived for young individuals of Gonatus madokai in the Sea of Okhotsk.

Both species are distinguished from many species of the genus by the presence of the transverse row of spinules on the sixth abdominal somite. Among several species with the transverse row, A. robusta is unique in having the long rostral plate with narrowly rounded apex and the shape and armature of the telson. A. tenuicauda is distinguishable by the long and slender antennal scale and the telson with subparallel lateral margins in the distal one-third.

N2  - A revision was made of the endemic Himalayan species of the genus Sympetrum based mainly on the collection of the National Science Museum, Tokyo. Sympetrum commixtum is believed to be the Himalayan form of S. striolatum which ranges from North Europe to Japan. The two species, S. hypomelas and S. orientale are endemic species in this area. Sympetrum haematoneura which has been an enigmatic insect from taxonomic viewpoint proved to be the vicariant of Japanese S. speciosum known in Japan and high mountains of Taiwan.

Our examination of newly-collected material from the type locality of this species (E1 Zarco, approximately 30km SW of Mexico, D. F., Mexico) proved that the species should be placed in the genus Dugesia GIRARD, 1850 : Dugesia azteca (BENAZZI et GIANNINI, 1971). Redescription of this species is given in the present paper, together with some taxonomic remarks and distributional notes on 7 Mexican dugesiid planarians (including 3 troglobitic, 1 troglophilic, and 3 epigean water species) known to the present.

Chromosomes of five tetraodontiform fishes (Lactoria diaphana, Ostracion immaculatus, Canthigaster coronata, Fugu pardalis, Fugu poecilonotus) were observed, and the structural morphology of the relation between the axial skeleton and pterygiophores of 102 species in Tetraodontiformes was reported. 2. Phylogenetic systematics of tetraodontiform fishes were studied on the basis of karyotypes and osteological characters by a newly revised method of WAGNER's (1969) groundplan/divergence method. By analysis of 17 osteological characters, living tetraodontiform fishes were classified into 6 families (Triacanthodidae, Triacanthidae, Balistidae, Ostraciidae, Triodontidae and Tetraodontidae), although the systematic position of a monophyletic group corresponding to Molidae sensu TYLER (1980) was left for a future study. Among above 6 families, phylogenetic classification of Balistidae, Ostraciidae and Tetraodontidae was constructed after phylogenetic interrelationships in above 3 families were reconstructed. On the basis of 12 osteological characters and karyotypes, 63 species of Balistidae were classified into 2 subfamilies, Balistinae and Monacanthinae. Balistinae was considered to be ancestral to Monacanthinae which consists of 3 tribes. On the basis of 11 osteological characters and karyotypes, 17 species of Ostraciidae were grouped into 2 subfamilies, Aracaninae and Ostraciinae. Aracaninae was considered to be ancestral to Ostraciinae which was separated to 3 tribes. On the basis of 9 osteological characters, the nasal apparatus and karyotypes, 48 species of Tetraodontidae were classified into 3 subfamilies, Liosaccinae (nov.), Lagocephalinae and Tetraodontinae. Tetraodontinae was classified into 5 tribes, one of which corresponds to Diodontidae sensu TYLER (1980).

N2  - Two new species and a new subspecies of the trechine genus Trechiama are described from the central part of the Island of Shikoku, Southwest Japan. One of them, named T. cornutus, is known only from a schist cave, and its subspecies, T. c. longior, from a mine adit, while the other new species, T. perissus, has been found both in a schist cave and from the upper hypogean zone. A new species-complex is recognized for these species in the group of T. chikaichii, because of the peculiarities of elytral chaetotaxy and male genitalia.

N2  - Through the courtesy of Messrs. Setsuro HASHIMOTO and Tetsuro MIZUNUMA, the author was able to examine a series of specimens of a new buprestid of the genus Demochroa, collected by Mr. Hideo DETANI on the Island of Peleng of the Banggi Islands which lie off the eastern coast of Central Celebes. Demochroa WHITE, 1859,is the monotypic genus based upon D. carinata WHITE, 1859 (=lacordairei THOMSON, 1859), from Halmahera. The range of D. lacordairei THOMSON, 1859,the type-species of the genus, is confined to Halmahera and its fringing islands. In the author's view, its records from Borneo and Sumatra are most probably erroneous. Demochroa gratiosa H. DEYROLLE, 1864,described from the Malay Peninsula and also recorded from the Indochinese Peninsula, Burma, Assam, the Andamans and Java, may belong to a genus other than Demochroa. Therefore, the discovery of a new and true Demochroa-species on the Island of Peleng is most unexpected and worthy of special mention.

N2  - In the present paper is described a new crab referred to the genus Globopilumnus, the representatives of which are close to the species of the Pilumnidae in their general formation of the carapace, chelipeds and ambulatory legs. Several genera including the genus in question are characteristic in having the whip-like long male second pleopods and have been considered to represent a natural group as one of the subfamilies of the Xanthidae since the excellent papers of BALSS (1932,1933). The current studies may appoint it to the familial rank as the Menippidae, although the discussion on this problem is not always fully matured. The new species is the sixth in Globopilumnus and readily distinguished from the known five species by its characteristic tomentum with a more or less labyrinth appearance. The type-specimens of the new species are preserved in the National Science Museum, Tokyo (NSMT) and the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory, Kyoto University (SMBL).

N2  - During the second half season of 1981,the experts in the Entomology Section, Department of Zoology, National Science Museum, Tokyo, made an extensive survey to Nepal. They made a good collection of Himalayan aeschnids paying special attention to the genus Cephalaeschna and its allies which totalled finally 65 specimens. Besides them, seven additional ones taken by Mr. Jun EMOTO became available. The first part of this paper is, consequently, a supplementary contribution to my previous reports (1981a, b), adding a number of interesting facts. For these fresh material I have to thank cordially to the painstaking field work of the survey members, namely, Prof. Shigeru AE (Nanzan University), Messrs. M. OWADA, Y. NISHIKAWA, M. SAKAI, M. TOMOKUNI and Dr. Shun-Ichi UENO. I am also very grateful to Mr. Jun EMOTO, Nanzan University, for some important material he obtained. Mr. Peter NIELSEN, Copenhagen Zoology Museum, was good enough to allow me to record Cephalaeschna klapperichi and C. orbifrons preserved in the Museum. In the second part of this article an attempt was made to compare the structure of male accessory genitalia of the second and third abdominal segments in the hope to confirm more precise generic characters, if any, of these taxonomically difficult aeschnids. Finally a diagnostic table was prepared to give a bird-eye view of the species of Cephalaeschna and its allied genera including those described from Chinese faunal limits (pp. 58-63).

N2  - This is the result of our study on chrysomelid beetles of Nepal, which were collected by the National Science Museum Expedition to East Nepal in 1979. A small number of Nepalese specimens in the collection of the museum were also examined. These chrysomelid beetles excluding Alticinae were classified into 63 species. Four species are described as new to science and 12 species are recorded from Nepal for the first time. All the specimens including the holotypes are deposited in the collection of the National Science Museum, except for some duplicates kept by the authors. We wish to express our hearty thanks to the members of the expedition for their pains and kindness in collecting these specimens during laborious surveys : Dr. S. -I. UENO, Messrs. M. OWADA and M. TOMOKUNI of the National Science Museum, Tokyo, Dr. M. SATO of Nagoya Women's University, Nagoya, and Mr. Y. NISHIKAWA of Ohtemon Gakuin University, Osaka. We are also thankful to Dr. Y. KUROSAWA of the museum for the loan of additional material.

N2  - In the autumn of 1981,the second Nepal Himalaya entomological expedition was made under the leadership of Dr. S.-I. UENO of the National Science Museum, Tokyo. The orthopterous material collected at that time was entrusted to me for study by Dr. UENO. In this material I found one new genus and species belonging to the Gomphomastacinae, Gomphomastacidae (DIRSH, 1975), which was collected in the western part of Nepal. The distributional area of gomphomastacine grasshoppers hitherto known includes Kazakhstan, Uzbekhstan, Tadzikhstan (Pamir), N. Afghanistan, Punjab, Karakorum, Kashmir, and W. China (the southwestern end of Tibet, Tien Shan, and Chinghai) (BEY-BIENKO and MISTSHENKO, 1951; DESCAMPS, 1973; ZHENG and HANG, 1974; YIN, 1979; CHENG, 1981). However, this extends further south according to the occurrence of the Gomphomastacinae in western Nepal. In the following lines, a description of this new species is presented, together with that of the new genus and a key to the genera of the Gomphomastacinae. This is the first report dealing with the Nepalese Orthoptera brought forth by the National Science Museum party. Before going further, I wish to express my hearty thanks to Dr. Shun-Ichi UENO for giving me the privilege of studying the material of the Nepalese Orthoptera. Thanks are also due to Messrs. Masaaki TOMOKUNI and Mamoru OWADA who attentively collected grasshoppers for me as members of the Museum party.

N2  - The meconematine insects are small tettigonids living in forests and on leaves. They are poorly known in Japan, and the classification of Japanese members is not satisfactory at present. Three meconematine species are hitherto known in Japan, that is, Meconema subpunctatum, "M. ?" albicorne now under the genus Alloteratura, and Teratura suzukii now placed in the genus Xiphidiopsis. Though the first two species were described by MOTSCHULSKY in 1866,his descriptions are so incomplete, being written only in four or five lines, that it is very difficult to determine what their true entities are. Up to the present, no body can determine the true identity of Meconema subpunctatum. The third is the species described by MATSUMURA and SHIRAKI in 1908. In this paper, I am going to deal with three long-winged species including MATSUMURA and SHIRAKI's and one of MOTSCHULSKY's forms in order to elucidate the Japanese members of the Meconematinae and, in addition, to give descriptions of two new genera and a new brachypterous species.

N2  - Chromosomes of cyprinid fishes have been studied more intensively than those of any other family of fishes except the family Cyprinodontidae (VASILIEV, 1980). As regards Japanese cyprinids, chromosomes of 20 genera and 35 species-subspecies have been hitherto reported (OJIMA & HITOTSUMACHI, 1967; OJIMA et al., 1970,1972,1973,1976; ITOH & NIIYAMA, 1972; KOBAYASI et al., 1970,1973a, 1973b; ARAI & FUJIKI, 1977). As I had the chance to observe chromosomes of two cyprinid fishes, Acrossocheilus labiatus from Taiwan and Pseudorasbora pumila pumila from Japan, their karyotypes are here described. As regards Eurasian cyprinid fishes, karyotypes of 58 genera and 141 species-subspecies have been reported, including those of two species in this paper. Their karyotypes are reviewed in this paper and phylogenetic systematics of Eurasian cyprinid fishes are discussed on the basis of karyotypes and several morphological characters. Method of chromosome preparation is the same as that of ARAI (1973). Classification of chromosomes is adopted from LEVAN et al. (1964). Metacentrics and submetacentrics are described as two-arm chromosomes, and subtelocentrics and acrocentrics as one-arm chromosomes. The definition of the new arm number (NAN) is referred to ARAI and NAGAIWA (1976). All the specimens used for the experiments are deposited in the fish collection of the Department of Zoology, National Science Museum, Tokyo.

N2  - A new nematode belonging to the family Physalopteridae was obtained from a primitive, deep-sea frill shark, Chlamydoselachus anguineus, caught off the Pacific coast of central Honshu, the main island of Japan. On the other hand, the larva was also found lying on the brain of a deep-sea bristlemouth, Cyclothone atraria, taken from the Pacific coast of northern Honshu. The life cycle of this nematode is briefly speculated. The nematodes were preserved in 70% ethanol and cleared in glycerin or Gater's solution. The specimens are deposited in the collection of the National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo.

N2  - During the course of a study on oceanic cephalopods eaten by longnose lancetfish, Alepisaurus ferox, in the Tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans, two species of the genus Onykia LESUEUR, 1821,were found. As this genus has been monotypic, these two have hitherto been undescribed. One of them seems to be conspecific with a squid inadequately identified by myself (1968) and, subsequently, described (but given no name) by RANCUREL (1970). The other one is sympatric with the former. I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Kiyoshi FUJITA, Tokyo University of Fisheries, for his kind offer of extensive collection of Alepisaurus stomach contents at my disporsal. Thanks are also due to Mrs. Pauline DAYARANTHA, Department of Fisheries, Sri-Lanka, and Mr. Shin-ichi TSUKADA, Tokai University, for their help in sorting and measuring the specimens under study.

N2  - The gunnel family Pholididae is one of the most specialized groups of the northern blennies distributed in the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, and the Arctic Oceans. They generally live on the bottom and occupy littoral and coastal sea shore habitats. Since the Pholididae lack conspicuous external characters such as complicated lateral lines or fleshy crests, they are still confused with other members of the northern blennies, e. g., with Opisthocentrinae by GREENWOOD et al. (1966). Compared to external morphology, internal features such as the hemanephrapophyses (MAKUSHOK, 1958) are unique among the northern blennies and supply the definitive information on monophyly (sensu HENNIG, 1966). As the first step in trying to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship and the diversity of the Pholididae and to offer some aid for the northern blenny classification, this taxonomic review is made below.

N2  - A specimen of a remarkable triggerfish (Balistidae) was found in the stomach contents of the marlinfish Makaira mazara (Istiophoridae) collected from off the Marianas Islands on July 9,1960. It is readily distinguishable from all other balistids by having great protuberances just below the pectoral fins. Since this unusual cahracter is not found in any other balistid, a dissection was made to ascertain if this specimen had any unique internal characters. Although the viscera of the specimen were completely digested by the stomach of M. mazara, the skeleton was still in good condition and shows uniqueness in the pectoral girdle, skull and the first dorsal fin. Thus, the specimen is here described as a new genus and species under the name of Xenobalistes tumidipectoris. The holotype, only known specimen, is deposited in the fish collection of the National Science Museum, Tokyo (NSMT-P).

N2  - During the sampling travel to the Ogasawara Islands (Fig. 1) in August 1979 and June 1980,a total of 36 specimens of inlandwater shrimps was collected by the senior author and the colleague. At first sight they were without doubt morphologically similar to Palaemon (Palaemon) pacificus (STIMPSON) which is widely distributed in the coastal waters of the Indo-West Pacific waters north to Honshu, Japan (KUBO, 1942; HOLTHUIS, 1950). For example they share some features in common with P. pacificus such as the long rostrum with two or three teeth behind the orbit and four or five teeth on the lower margin, but are readily distinguished from it by having some definitive features as noted below. They are described as a new species in the following lines, with notes on the morphological variation. The holotype and some of the paratypes are kept in the National Science Museum, Tokyo (NSMT) and the other paratypes are deposited at the Museum, Tokyo University of Fisheries (MTUF).

N2  - In the present paper, I am going to describe two new anophthalmic species of trechine beetles recently discovered in abandoned mine adits lying at the northern part of the Kinki District, Central Japan. Both the species belong to the kosugei complex of the group of Trechiama oni, and should have been included in the map showing the distribution of Trechiama in the Kinki District given on page 267 of my previous paper (UENO, 1980), if they had been known before its publication. And if this had been realized, the peripheries of the distributional ranges of the group of T. ohshimai and that of T. oni could have been demonstrated more precisely. The occurrence of one of the present new species in a mine adit at the northern tip of Osaka Prefecture is of particular importance from the zoogeographic view-point, since this mine is located on the line connecting the known ranges of the two different species belonging to the group of T. ohshimai. The abbreviations used herein are the same as those explained elsewhere (e. g., UENO, 1980,p. 196). Before going further, I wish to express my deep indebtedness to Messrs. Yoshiaki NISHIKAWA and Akira NOTO for their continuous support of my study.

N2  - The suborder Percoidei is the largest among 12 suborders of perciform fishes. It contains 72 families, 595 genera and about 3935 species (NELSON, 1976). This suborder is considered to be the most basic in the order Perciformes. However, interrelation-ships of percoid fishes are so complicated that construction of their phylogenetic tree is very difficult. Although there are so many families in the suborder Percoidei, karyological studies on percoid fishes are very poor except on some families such as Centrarchidae, Percidae, Chaetodontidae, Cichlidae and Pomacentridae (VASILIEV, 1980). As we observed chromosomes of six species of percoid fishes from Japan, i. e., two species of the family Kuhliidae, one species each of the family Gerreidae, the family Leiognathidae, the family Chaetodontidae and the family Embiotocidae, we describe their karyotypes and discuss relationships between karyotypes and morphological characters in some percoid families. Method of chromosome preparation is the same as that of ARAI (1973). Classification of chromosomes is adopted from LEVAN et al. (1964). Metacentrics and submetacentrics are described as two-arm chromosomes, subtelocentrics and acrocentrics as one-arm chromosomes. The definition of the new arm number (NAN) is referred to ARAI and NAGAIWA (1976). All the specimens used for the experiments are deposited in the fish collection of the Department of Zoology, National Science Museum, Tokyo.

N2  - Taking part in the National Science Museum Expedition to Nepal 1979 which was carried out under the leadership of Dr. Shun-Ichi UENO, I had an opportunity to visit East Nepal. During our stay made from September to November, I was able to make rather a large collection of the aquatic Coleoptera. Although most of them are still under the course of study, I am going to deal with dryopid beetles in the present paper as the first result of my researches. Up to the present, no dryopid beetles have been known from Nepal, but I was fortunate to obtain a small number of specimens of these beetles during the trip. Thirteen specimens in total were included in the collection; they were classified into three species of three different genera. Two of them seem to be new species and will be described in the following lines, while the remaining one will be left unnamed as it is known from only females. I am very grateful to Dr. S. -I. UENO for his kindness in giving me the opportunity to participate in the expedition and to publish this paper. Hearty thanks are also due to Messrs. Y. NISHIKAWA, M. OWADA and M. TOMOKUNI for their kind help in the collecting trip.

N2  - Some years ago Dr. Takashi OKUTANI of Tokai Regional Fisheries Research Laboratory kindly provided the National Science Museum, Tokyo, with a large collection of crabs from the submarine banks along the Izu Islands in Central Japan. The collection is composed of many interesting species, some of which are considered to be new to science or newly recorded from Japanese waters. In due time the records of all the species will be published by the senior author, but in this short paper the description of a new species of Calocarcinus is preliminarily presented as a part of the authors' extensive discussion on trapeziid crabs. The new species is the third in the genus which is represented by C. africanus CALMAN, 1909 and C. habei TAKEDA, 1980. The type-specimen of the new speices, the holotype female, is preserved in the National Science Museum, Tokyo (NSMT). The senior author wishes to thank Dr. T. OKUTANI who is now the leading staff of the Department of Zoology in the National Science Museum, Tokyo, for his kindness of placing the valuable specimens in the senior author's hand for study. The junior atuhor's cordial thanks are due to Prof. Ch. LEWINSOHN of Tel-Aviv University for his continuous guidance and encouragement, to whom the new species is dedicated.

N2  - The anophthalmic trechine beetles of the group of Trechiama ohshimai are classified into twenty-two species, of which nineteen are new to science and one is revived. Though closely similar to one another, these species can be divided into the following five complexes : 1) T. subparallelus sp. nov. and T. sasajii sp. nov., 2) T. grandicollis sp. nov., T. nagahinis S. UENO, T. parvus sp. nov., T. tsurugaensis sp. nov. and T. tenuiformis sp. nov., 3) T. applanatus sp. nov., T. canalatus sp. nov., T. angulicollis JEANNEL, T. rotundipennis sp. nov., T. mahoae sp. nov., T. brevior sp. nov., T. intermedius sp. nov., T. insularis sp. nov., T. gracilior sp. nov., T. sigma sp. nov., T. ohshimai (S. UENO) and T. inermis sp. nov., 4) T. spinosus sp. nov. and T. suzukaensis sp. nov., and 5) T. inexpectatus sp. nov. The first complex seems to be the most primitive, the second the next, and the third the most advanced, while the fourth and the fifth are regarded as derivative offshoots. Reasons are given from both the morphological and zoogeographic aspects. All the species are either described or redescribed, and are also diagnosed in a key. The type designation of the genus Trechiama is reviewed, and the type-species is definitely settled on Trechiama angulicollis JEANNEL, 1954 (=Trechus Oreas sensu JEANNEL, 1927,nec H. W. BATES, 1883).

N2  - From the view point of comparative karyology, we have examined chromosomes of various groups of teleostean fishes from Japan. Recently we observed chromosomes of two species of freshwater fishes transplanted into Japan, i.e., Sarotherodon niloticus (Cichlidae) from Africa and Basilichthys bonariensis (Atherinidae) from South America. As far as we know, the diploid chromosome number of S. niloticus was preliminarily reported by JALABERT et al. (1971), but the karyotype of B. bonariensis has not been studied. We describe their karyotypes in this paper. Method of chromosome preparation is the same as that of ARAI (1973). Classification of chromosomes is adopted from LEVAN et al. (1964). Metacentrics and submetacentrics are described as two-arm chromosomes, and subtelocentrics and acrocentrics as one-arm chromosomes. The definition of the new arm number (NAN) is referred to ARAI and NAGAIWA (1976). All the specimens used for the experiments are deposited in the fish collection of the Department of Zoology, National Science Museum, Tokyo.

N2  - Troglocarcinus heimi and T. stimpsoni described by FIZE & SERENE (1955a, b) are peculiar in having the deeply excavated anterior half of the carapace. Several specimens from the Ryukyu Islands were identified with T. heimi and a new species close to it. After careful consideration of their relationship to the representatives of Troglocarcinus and the related genera, we came to a conclusion that the three species in question are not congeneric with the type-species of Troglocarcinus, T. corallicola VERRILL from the Bermudas, Straits of Florida and West Indies. Thus, in the following lines a new genus is established to accomodate the three Indo-West Pacific species. Before going further we must express our cordial thanks to Dr. Robert H. GORE of the Smithsonian Institution, Ft. Pierce Bureau, who kindly provided us with the elaborate sketches of T. corallicola. The junior author's cordial thanks are due to Dr. Ryosuke ISHIKAWA of Tokyo Metropolitan University for giving him the opportunity to make this study. The new species described in this paper is dedicated to and named after him.

N2  - In the present paper the taxonomic section of the studies on the family Par-holaspidae of the suborder Mesostigmata (Acari) from Japan is dealt with. It was carried out on the basis of more than 2,500 slides prepared from materials taken at about 550 localities distributed all over Japan, from Hokkiado in the north to Iriomote, one of the southernmost islands of the Ryukyus. As the result, seven genera and twenty-seven species of parholaspid mites have been known to occur in Japan. Of these, one genus and nineteen species, six of which were already described in his previous papers, are the taxa established by the author himself and the remaining eight are newly recorded from Japan.

N2  - Local variations are frequently observed in the species of the carabid subgenus Coptolabrus MORAWITZ, 1886,occurring in the Chinese Continent. Two new forms described in the following lines are the examples of such a case in Formosa and Korea. Before going further, the authors wish to express their sincere gratitude to Mr. Toyoichi SHIMONOYA of Fukui City for his kind loan of material for this study and to Mr. Hirotaka MATSUKA for taking photographs.

N2  - When I started in the study of Japanese Herminiinae, Mr. Shigero SUGI, Tokyo, kindly called my attention to the existence of a rare Zanclognatha species which had been left undetermined in his cabinet. It resembles Z. lunalis (SCOPOLI) to some extent in the ground colour and wing patterns, but is not so similar in its genitalic character to the latter species. Besides, I became aware of a very interesting and unexpected fact that the forelegs of this species are not modified even in the male, though they always show some specialization in the other species of Zanclognatha. In this paper, this interesting species will be described and its phylogenetic relationship will be discussed.

N2  - The genus Anoplodera has been divided into several subgenera, of which Kanekoa MATSUSHITA et TAMANUKI, 1942,is monotypic, having been based upon A. azumensis MATSUSHITA et TAMANUKI from Mt. Azumasan, northern Honshu, Japan. Recently, the author found the second species of the subgenus in the northern mountains of Taiwan. It will be described in the present paper under the name of A. (K.) lalashana. The author wishes herewith to express his sincere gratitude to Dr. Yoshihiko KUROSAWA and Dr. Shun-Ichi UENO of the National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo, and Professer Yasuaki WATANABE, Tokyo University of Agriculture, for their constant guidance. The author is also indebted to Messrs. Tetsuji KAMAKARI of Osaka and Shusei SAITO of Kanagawa for kindly supplying with the invaluable specimens used in the present study.
